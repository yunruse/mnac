    <h4>How do I play?</h4>
    <small><em>
            <p>
                If you don't want to use a mouse, use the keys
                <kbd>123 456 789</kbd>
                to select the respective board or cell.
                <kbd>QWE ASD ZXC</kbd> works for noughts, and
                <kbd>UIO JKL M,.</kbd> for crosses.
                You can always press <kbd>Backspace</kbd> to undo.
            </p>
        </em></small>
    <p>
        As you can see, there are nine boards, each with nine cells.
        Each board is its own game of noughts and crosses. If you win
        three cells in a line, you win that board -- if you win three
        boards in a line, you win the game!
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>The golden rule, however, is that your opponent always plays in a different board.</strong>
        Almost always, this is your choice. If you play in the top-left cell, say, your opponent will
        be sent to the top-left board. Therefore to take a board, your opponent has to actually send you there
        - the fun of the game is using your wits to convince them to let you.
    </p>
    <p>
        A few useful tips:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If a cell would send you somewhere disallowed -- for example, the same board,
            or one that has been won or drawn -- it is a <em>teleporter</em>, marked in green.
            Playing a cell there results in you being able to choose which board to send your opponent to.
            Use them before your opponent does!
        </li>
        <li>
            Towards the endgame, the golden rule may be useful to
            trap your opponent in a board by only leaving two left.
        </li>
        <li>
            The middle board is quite useful.
            Some times a house rule holds that the first player isn't allowed to start there.
        </li>
    </ul>
